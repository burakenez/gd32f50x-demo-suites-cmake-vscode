  This example is based on the GD32F503V-EVAL-V1.1 board, it shows how to configure the
comparator trigger interrupt using an external interrupt line. 

  CMP0 is configured as following:
  - Inverting input is internally connected to VREFINT = 1.2V.
  - Non Inverting input is connected to PA7.
  - Output is internally connected to EXTI line 18.
  EXTI is configured as following:
  - Enable the exti line 18 interrupt.

  After system start-up, enable comparator and trigger interrupt, then LED2 will turn on and 
off when the CMP0 output level changes.
  While PA7 is lower than VREFINT, LED2 is off.
  While PA7 is higher than VREFINT, LED2 is on.
